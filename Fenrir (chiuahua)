‎
‎=== Background Story – Fenrir ===
‎Fenrir was once an ordinary Chihuahua, kept as a household pet.
‎Alert, loud, and utterly convinced that he was personally responsible for defending the territory against all airborne threats.
‎
‎His owner was a druid.
‎Why the druid chose to Awaken his Chihuahua was never fully explained.
‎Loneliness, curiosity, or simple amusement — the goal was one thing: a speaking companion.
‎
‎Awakened, Fenrir gained words and reasoning, but not humility.
‎Self-doubt is unknown to Chihuahuas.
‎
‎Later, a celestial being appeared in the Dreamlands.
‎An angel, tasked with selecting a champion to oppose a rising Demon Lord, called forth potential candidates in shared dreams.
‎
‎When Fenrir’s turn came, he stepped forward without hesitation.
‎He recounted battles against winged demons as large as wagons,
‎airborne terrors descending from above,
‎and desperate fights fought with courage vastly exceeding his size.
‎(has shown the Angel His Memories about that)
‎
‎The angel was impressed.
‎
‎What was never clarified:
‎- Fenrir was a Chihuahua.
‎- The “truck-sized bird demons” were ordinary pigeons.
‎- The scale of the events was non-human in perspective.
‎- for Fenrir that was what has happened.
‎- Fenrir was honest. 
‎- its a missunderstanding, Nobody Care about:
‎-> the Angel has His "brave Warrior" (Box ticked, end of Story)
‎-> Fenrir has His Holly Task, Quest (that the Angel even has thought to give that to Anyone Else was a sacrileg beforehand)
‎
‎
‎The angel focused on conviction, not context.
‎Fearlessness, absolute confidence, and unwavering presence convinced the celestial to seal the pact.
‎
‎Fenrir awoke as a celestial warlock, champion of the heavens.
‎Correcting the misunderstanding never seemed necessary — it felt far too late.

-----
When Fenrir was still a tiny puppy, he often played with what everyone assumed was an imaginary friend — a strange, platypus-like creature only he could see.

The being treated him much the way a person treats a cute puppy they meet on the street: amused, entertained, faintly fond, but utterly unconcerned with responsibility. It watched him stumble, chase his tail, and bark at shadows. It teased him gently. It offered running commentary in a voice only Fenrir could hear — curious, snarky, and never quite invested. Fenrir Hasnt mind, because a dog dosnt realice what is "happening" , dosnt mind the Eldritch being.

To the eldritch spectator, Fenrir is a beloved curiosity — a living toy whose victories and disasters are equally delightful to watch unfold. It would never intentionally harm him… but it would also never stop him from walking off a metaphorical cliff.

After all, watching how he handles the fall is far too fascinating to interrupt.

---> or the imaginary Friend is only a mechanism of Fenrirs psyche to handle the Reality. - its not clear - Fenrir is the only one who sees tis entity, and the entity does nothing else.
