========================================
BACKGROUND STORY – FENRIR
========================================

Fenrir was once an ordinary Chihuahua.
Alert, loud, and utterly convinced that he alone was responsible for defending
his territory from all airborne threats.

His owner was a gnome druid.
Why the druid chose to Awaken his dog was never explained.
Loneliness, curiosity, or simple amusement—only the result mattered.

Awakened, Fenrir gained speech and reason.
He did not gain humility.

Later, a celestial being appeared in shared dreamlands.
An angel, seeking a champion against a rising Demon Lord,
called forth potential candidates.

Fenrir stepped forward without hesitation.

He spoke of desperate battles against massive winged demons,
of skies filled with terror,
of courage far greater than his body.

(They were pigeons.)

Fenrir did not lie.
He understood the world as a dog understands it.

The angel focused on conviction, not context.
Fearlessness. Absolute certainty. Unyielding presence.

The pact was sealed.

Fenrir awoke as a Celestial Warlock.
Correcting the misunderstanding never seemed necessary.
It was far too late for that.


========================================
THE IMAGINARY FRIEND (AMBIGUOUS – FLAVOR)
========================================

Since puppyhood, Fenrir has perceived a strange, platypus-like entity.
A watcher. A commentator. A spectator.

Only Fenrir sees it.
It never interferes.
It might be real.
It might be a coping mechanism.

Either way, it is always watching.
